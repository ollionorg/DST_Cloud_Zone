## Project Overview

The DST Multi-Cloud Transformation Plan is a modern web application that visualizes and explains the cloud transformation strategy. It's built as a static website with serverless API integration, deployed on Vercel for optimal performance and scalability.

### Key Features
- Interactive navigation with smooth transitions
- Dynamic content sections with expandable details
- Visual roadmap using Chart.js
- Mobile-responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- AI-powered insights through Gemini API integration

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
```
public/
├── index.html      # Main application entry point
├── styles.css      # Custom styles and Tailwind utilities
└── script.js       # Client-side JavaScript functionality
```

### Backend Architecture
```
api/
├── hello.js        # Basic API endpoint
└── generateInsights.js  # Gemini API integration endpoint
```

The application follows a serverless architecture pattern:
- Static assets are served directly from Vercel's CDN
- API endpoints are implemented as serverless functions
- Client-side JavaScript handles dynamic content and interactions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for content structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with Tailwind CSS framework + Inclusion of Ollion Colors and Elements
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side interactivity
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library

### Backend
- **Vercel Serverless Functions**: API endpoints
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for serverless functions

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control
- **Vercel CLI**: Deployment and development
- **npm**: Package management

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v14 or higher)
2. npm (v6 or higher)
3. Git
4. Vercel CLI (optional)

### Local Development Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd dst_cloudzone
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Local Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
